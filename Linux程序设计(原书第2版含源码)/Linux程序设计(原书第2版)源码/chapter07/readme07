dbm1.c    -  A simple database program.

dbm2.c    -  An improved database program.


CD Application.

app/makefile  -  The application's makefile. (See Chapter 8.)

app/cd_data.h   -  The header file for the following files.

app/app_ui.c    -  The application's user interface.

app/cd_access.c -  The dbm side of the application.

To compile the application:
